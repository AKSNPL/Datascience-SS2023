We tried first to do with the code above for getting the clinical data and doing the survival analysis using specific gene from TCGA and also using UCSCXenaTools, a nice guide is also provided here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/09/ucscxenatools-retrieve-gene-expression-and-clinical-information-from-ucsc-xena-for-survival-analysis/ , but due to lack of clinical data for ESCC in UCSCXenaTools (as far as we tried), we couldnt continue with them. So for survival analysis , we used the website http://www.bioinfo-zs.com/esccexpress/
