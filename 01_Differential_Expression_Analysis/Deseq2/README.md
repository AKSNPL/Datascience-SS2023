Since we found out that the significant genes found by DESeq2 were more or less same to Limma, we stick to the limmas result for further analysis. <br /> 
Here are the file description for this folder:

Deseq2_GSE29001.pdf : contains a description of plots and the steps for one GEO dataset named GSE29001. <br /> 
For all other files the steps were same which can be found on the folder mRNA and miRNA respectively.
